Installing emacs on Z440. Following instructions from 2015-10-31 Sat 02:25 PM

Chocolatey's emacs client opens a terminal everytime it's run. Instead download
windows binaries that support images, as recommended by the spacemac's guide.
choco uninstall emacs
http://emacsbinw64.sourceforge.net/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/emacsbinw64/
Download, extract with 7zip to C:\Program Files\emacs. Then create a start menu
shortcut of emacs\bin\runemacs.exe in
C:\Users\vigan\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs
by alt dragging it in explorer.
Add an environment variable %HOME% to be C:\Users\vigan\
    - search environment in start
    - put value as HOME, without %'s
    - check in command prompt: echo %HOME%
Install spacemacs by creating a hard link between C:\Users\vctrg\.emacs.d and a
cloned folder of the spacemacs repository.
Choose VIM-style and standard distribution

From: http://magit.vc/manual/magit/Installing-from-an-Elpa-archive.html#Installing-from-an-Elpa-archive
Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the local package list using:
M-x package-refresh-contents RET
Once you have done that, you can install Magit and its dependencies using:
M-x package-install RET magit RET

(M is alt)

Installation steps on a new HP Z440
- Unwrap the PC. Plug in a monitor, mouse, keyboard and a connected ethernet cable.
- Boot up and spam Esc to enter BIOS, and boot to network drive. F2/F10/F12 are other options to spam.
  - If you get an issue where you can't click "Boot to Network", restart your computer, click Esc to boot to BIOS, and boot to network
- Boot to Network, IPv4
- Choose the default selected Windows Image (the first one, with office 2016)
- Confirm Identity: alias is just X, where X is X@microsoft.com (no REDMOND\)
- Choose Windows 10 (64-Bit)
- Computer Name: I use VIGAN-3-1013, where VIGAN is my alias, 3 is my building and 1013 is my office.
- If you run into a problem where it doesn't find any disks:
  - Deployment Readiness: TPM on this machine is not enabled. Bitlockefr will not be enabled on this machine.
    Or, open up your PC and  - No partition founod (either your device does not have a fixed disk or we do not havea driver for it)
  - This error happens because there is one SATA controller with 2 ports and one eSATA controller with 3 ports. Only the SATA controller is enabled for network boot, and none of your drives are on those 2 ports. Call tech support. Or, open up your PC and move the SSD drive's (your desired OS drive) SATA port from the rightmost gray eSATA port to the bottom-most black SATA port on the vertical side.
- Keep existing partitions during installation? No
  - Verify your SSD size is what's shown.
- New password for the local administrator account: put this in your password manager
- It will take around half an hour to install. When done, you should get a screen saying 'Deployment completed successfully :)"
- When I booted in, the two hard drive disks were not detected.
  - I changed the BIOS to the default settings; it didn't do much.
  - It looks like no RAID Controller is installed, and both the SATA and eSATA controllers were set to RAID (as opposed to AHCI or IDE)
  - I set the eSATA controller to AHCI in the BIOS. On Reboot, the new drives are visible. I then set the SATA controller to AHCI as well.
  - Enable Bitlocker
  - Open Skype for Business
  - Open Outlook
